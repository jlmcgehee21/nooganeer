This project was the bulk of my research in graduate school.  Hybrid powertrain systems are highly optimizable, and with the rise of hybrid vehicles in the marketplace, I thought this was a very relevant topic.  I hope that researchers for the big automotive companies are implementing advanced optimization methods for production vehicles.

This research won the award for Best Mechanical Engineering Graduate Research at the TTU Student Research Day 2013.  I also presented this research at the http://papers.sae.org/2013-01-0482/[SAE World Congress] in Detroit, and it was published in the http://www.nooganeer.com/his/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Proceedings-of-the-Institution-of-Mechanical-Engineers-Part-D-Journal-of-Automobile-Engineering-2014-McGehee-0954407014548739.pdf[Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers].  Below are links to the source code and other documents related to my research in this area.
