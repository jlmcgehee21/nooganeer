The main focus of my job is scientific computing.  Python is an excellent environment for this, but once I have some code that works as well as I like, it's nice to be able to share it with co-workers, or just set it up to run independently on my machine.  A link to the Bitbucket repo is at the bottom of the article. Please clone/fork the repo and follow along. The source has only been tested on OSX, but should work in Linux with a little modification. I may make a Linux version in the future.

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT PACKAGE CODE FOR MASS DISTRIBUTION PROFESSIONALLY.  THE METHOD I WILL PRESENT HERE IS WHAT I USE TO DISTRIBUTE A SMALL NUMBER OF COPIES OF MY CODE TO NON-PYTHON USERS WHO I TRUST, AND WHO ALSO TRUST ME.  THERE IS PROBABLY A MORE SECURE/RELIABLE METHOD, BUT THIS IS QUICK, EASY, AND WORKS IN MY SITUATION.*

I have had only mediocre success with tools like http://pythonhosted.org//py2app/[py2app]. Therefore, I developed a method using shell scripts and virtualenv that allows for a python "application" to easily be installed in OSX.

To begin, I am assuming that you have knowledge about why virtualenv is the proper way to develop in python.  If not, please read here: http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/

Now, let's assume you already have a nice simple module called "MyApp.py". Go ahead and make a project directory "MyAppDist". Following the example in the repo, the final structure of your project will be like so:

``

MyAppDist/

---------requirements.txt(pip requirements file)

---------install.sh

---------virtualEnvSetup.sh

---------setIcon.sh

---------bin/

------------MyApp(shell script)

------------MyApp.py(your source)

---------media/

------------MyLogo.png(logo of your choice)

Overview & Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`install.sh` manages the other scripts in the main project directory. It installs an "application bundle" containing a virtualenv with the packages listed in `requirements.txt` and an executable shell script that activates the packaged virtualenv and runs the python source. `install.sh` also makes a fancy logo for your launcher and gives the user an option to make a desktop shortcut.

So. All you need to do to distribute your python application is share your "MyAppDist" directory. The user will then run `$ bash install.sh`, and the app will be install in the `pwd`.

The final app structure will be as follows:

``

MyApp/

---------bin/

------------MyApp(shell script)

------------MyApp.py(your source)

---------ProjectEnv/

------------...

To launch the application, simply run MyApp (Double Click, Spotlight, Alfred, etc.)!
