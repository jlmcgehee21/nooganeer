This is a short tutorial I built to present at a Chattanooga Data Science meetup. I have since presented at Chattanooga Developer's Lunch, and Chattanooga Python Users Group. My main goal here, rather than to do a in-depth analysis/prediction, is to showcase some of the awesome Python tools available for data science.

I am looking at a small, but interesting dataset regarding fatal car accidents, their causes, and a couple of auto insurance metrics by U.S. state. This dataset comes from http://fivethirtyeight.com/[FiveThirtyEight], a popular statistics blog. You can download it from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bad-drivers[FiveThirtyEight's Github], or you can download this entire iPython Notebook with all the necessary data files from my https://bitbucket.org/jeff_mcgehee/cds_presentation_intro[Bitbucket repo].

I did this short exercise on my own without examining the FiveThirtyEight article in order to eliminate any influence if might have on how I decided to look through/at the data. You can check out the http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers/["Dear Mona" post at FiveThirtyEight].
